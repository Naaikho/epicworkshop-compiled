## WOW ! Epic Workshop? What's this ?

Epic Workshop is software that will allow Rocket League players to enjoy workshop maps on Epic Games (and Steam as well).

## Really? And how does it work?

### Quick explanation:
Epic Workshop replaces the training map of your choice with the custom map that you also define, you will only have to go to training on the map in question to be able to enjoy the custom map.

### In more detail:
Epic Workshop has a "map" folder where you can put your downloaded workshop maps (in .zip or .udk) that you can find later in the software.
Steam players can choose whether or not the software detects which Steam workshop maps you have downloaded in addition to the "map" folder.
Then, choose one of the available training maps to replace it with the desired workshop map.
Click on "Swap" and. . .
enjoy!
